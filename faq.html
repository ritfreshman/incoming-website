What meal plan is best for me?
The Tiger 10 is the most popular, cheapest, and is often more than enough. However, if you have your doubts consider starting with the Tiger 14, you have the first week to change meal plans, this way you can either decide to go up to the Tiger 19, drop to the Tiger 10, or stick with the 14.
